  # Hello!
  #### I’m **Hugo Ruiz**, and I'm currently sudying a vocational training course
+  > I’m interested in:
   - Cars
   - Motorbikes
   - Computing and programming
   - Hardware/software configurations


+   I’m also currently learning how **proxmox** works at school, and we´re using **MarkDown** to keep record of this project
-
   >  What is proxmox? 
   - It is an **open source** operating sistem designed to deploy and administrate *virtual machines*
 #### I’m looking forward to learn as much as I can in this course, so in a near future I can work in something I really like, like cybersecurity or programming services
